# My Recipes Website - First Project!

## Project Introduction

Welcome to my very first web development project! This website is dedicated to creating a simple and user-friendly online space for sharing and discovering delicious recipes.  As someone brand new to web development, I'm excited to embark on this learning journey and build something practical and enjoyable.

This project is focused on creating a basic recipe website from scratch.  It will be a place to:

* **Showcase a collection of recipes:** I'll be adding my favorite recipes, perhaps family recipes, or recipes I want to try out.
* **Clearly present recipe information:** Each recipe will include essential details like ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and maybe even images (if I get that far in this first iteration!).
* **Learn web development fundamentals:**  This project is as much about learning as it is about the end product.

## Skills I Will Demonstrate (and Learn!)

By the end of this project, I aim to have demonstrated the following skills (and learned a lot in the process!):

* **Basic HTML Structure:**  I will be using HTML to structure the content of my website, creating the layout for recipe pages, lists, and text.
* **Styling with CSS:**  I will apply CSS to make the website visually appealing, including styling text, images, and the overall layout to be easy to read and navigate.
* **Understanding of Web Development Fundamentals:**  This project will help me grasp the basic concepts of how websites are built and how HTML and CSS work together.
* **File Organization for Web Projects:** I'll learn how to organize my project files (HTML, CSS, images) in a structured and maintainable way.
* **Problem-Solving and Debugging:**  Inevitably, I'll encounter challenges and errors along the way, and I will develop my problem-solving and debugging skills to overcome them.

**Self-Reflection (Initial Goals):**

Before starting, I anticipate learning a lot about the foundational elements of web development. My primary goals are to:

* Create a functional website that displays recipes clearly.
* Gain confidence in writing HTML and CSS code.
* Understand the basic workflow of web development.
* Complete a project from start to (hopefully) finish!

This README is a starting point, and I may update it as the project progresses.  Wish me luck, and let's get cooking... with code! üç≥üíª
