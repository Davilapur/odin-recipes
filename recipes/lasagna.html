        <h2>Balsamic Marinated Chicken Breasts</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe I made up after eating LOADS of bland chicken breasts. Chicken is so easy to prepare and this recipe makes the meat extra tender and juicy.</p>
        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup balsamic vinegar</li>

            <li>½ cup water</li>
                
            <li>1 teaspoon dried minced onion</li>
                
            <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
                
            <li>½ teaspoon dried minced garlic</li>
                
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                
            <li>¼ teaspoon paprika</li>
                
            <li>¼ teaspoon crushed dried rosemary</li>
                
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried parsley flakes</li>
                
            <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>
                
            <li>⅛ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                
            <li>4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the balsamic vinegar, water, onion, red pepper flakes, garlic, salt, pepper, paprika, rosemary, parsley, chili powder, and oregano in a bowl, and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken breasts, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 30 minutes to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, or lightly grease a broiler pan. Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade, and place the chicken breasts onto the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken breasts are golden brown and no longer pink in the center, 30 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should reach 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
